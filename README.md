# Wikipedia-edit-history-analysis

Wikipedia is a wiki, which means it can be publicly edited by anyone even without having an account.               Such a system is always prone to issues like vandalism, content inconsistency, factual fallacies etc., In order keep these in check Wikipedia uses a variety of software suite like VandalProof 1Â¬ and active users who would are interested in same domain would review the changes as they are made. This has been the workhorse for Wikipedia content integrity so far. However, in this paper we propose a deep learning-based approach to automatically identify a user who is more prone to vandalize a Wiki given his edit count, age of the account, whether the account is blocked or active.!
